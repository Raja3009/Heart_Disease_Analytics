# Heart_Disease_Diagnostic_Analysis

##  Objective 🎯 
  The aim of this project is to use the given data and perform ETL and data analysis to infer
  key metrics and patterns in the dataset. In addition to this, different visualizations are 
  developed to depict meaningful relationships.


## Problem Statement ❓
◾ Health is real wealth in the pandemic time we all realized the brute effects of covid-19 on 
  all irrespective of any status. You are required to analyze this health and medical data 
  for better future preparation.
  
◾ As it is rightly said, ‘Health is Wealth’. We have realized this fact in the pandemic time 
  after witnessing the brute effects of Covid-19 on people of all age groups. Apart from 
  this, another major contributor to the death rate is heart-related diseases
  
◾ Heart diseases have been known to take a major toll on people’s lives. As a layman, we 
  may feel that the common factors for heart-related diseases are cardiac arrest or 
  blockages. But the dataset under analysis describes multiple different medical 
  parameters associated with the heart and their typical values. We will be analyzing the 
  relationships between them and studying the implications of changes in those 
  parameters. In this project, we will be incorporating the most trending and powerful BI 
  tool namely Tableau.
